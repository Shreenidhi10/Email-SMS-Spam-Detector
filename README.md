# SMS Spam Detector 📱🛡️

**SMS Spam Detector** is a machine learning-based application designed to classify SMS messages as either *spam* or *ham* (not spam). This tool helps users identify and filter out unwanted spam messages, ensuring a clutter-free inbox and enhanced productivity.

---

## Features 🚀

- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for spam detection.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for classifying messages.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Classify messages instantly using a trained model.
- **Custom Training:** Fine-tune the model with your own dataset for domain-specific spam detection.
- **Exportable Results:** Save classified results for future reference.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Designed to work seamlessly on low-resource devices.

---

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Data Input:** The user inputs SMS messages for classification.
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Messages are cleaned and tokenized to prepare them for analysis.
3. **Model Prediction:** A machine learning model predicts whether the message is spam or ham.
4. **Results Displayed:** The classification results are shown in real-time.

## Installation 🔧

To set up the SMS Spam Detector on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sms-spam-detector
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` if it's Flask-based or on a Streamlit interface.

---

## Usage ✨

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Input or paste the SMS message you want to analyze.
3. Click on the "Detect" button to classify the message.
4. View the results: *Spam* or *Ham*.

---

## Dataset 📊

The model is trained on the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, a publicly available dataset containing over 5,500 SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. You can extend the dataset by adding your own messages for training.

---

## Technologies Used 🖥️

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - Pandas and NumPy for data processing
  - Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
  - NLTK for text preprocessing
  - Streamlit for the user interface
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Naive Bayes (baseline)
  - Transformer-based models (optional for advanced users)

---

## Example Code Snippet 🧩

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Sample messages
messages = ["Free entry in 2 a weekly competition!", "Hey, are we meeting tonight?"]

# Load pre-trained model and vectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(messages)
model = MultinomialNB()

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)  # Output: ['spam', 'ham']
```
